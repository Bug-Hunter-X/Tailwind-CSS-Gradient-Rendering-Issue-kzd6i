```html
<div class="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 via-blue-600 to-purple-500 ...">
</div>
```
This corrected code uses a `via` color to ensure a smooth transition.  Additionally, check your other CSS rules and ensure no conflicting styles are overriding the gradient. For more complex gradients consider using a dedicated utility class or custom CSS where needed.  Always verify that your browser has sufficient support for the gradient functions you're using.
